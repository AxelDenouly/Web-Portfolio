                    <h2>More about <span>Axel Denouly</span></h2>
                    <P>My full name is <span class="color_span">Denouly Yapi Axel Jonas</span>. As the first-born in a sibling duo of two, I had the privilege of growing up as the only boy, with my younger sister trailing behind by five years. While my roots trace back to France, it was in Abidjan that I came into this world. My childhood unfolded seamlessly, without encountering major challenges. <br><br> My educational journey has consistently been characterized by my ability to stand out form others . I have consistently ranked among the top students in my classes, achieving these results without exerting excessive effort. My demeanor is defined by tranquility and respect towards others. <br><br>My introverted disposition manifests in various ways depending on the people and my mood at the time. I prefer measured interactions and strive not to disrupt the lives of others. I seek assistance when I am at an impasse or when confronted with pressing situations. My leisure pursuits include games, as well as music, movies, webtoons, and the cherished time spent with family and friends. <br><br>Regarding money, my perspective is pragmatic. My goal is not to amass wealth, but rather to achieve sufficient financial independence to avoid dependency and to support those dear to me. I voluntarily abstain from alcohol consumption due to my taste preferences, gravitating more towards sweet beverages. <br><br>When I engage in an endeavor that ignites my passion, I wholeheartedly dedicate myself, sparing no effort. Similarly, I know how to detach when the situation demands it, displaying a balanced approach. My aspiration is to consistently give my best, while also being flexible when circumstances require.</P>

                    <h2>Why have I chosen the <span class="color_span">Computer Science</span> ?</h2>
                    <P>This part of my life represents one of my greatest sources of regrets, as I am aware of my intellectual abilities. However, a lack of information and ill-advised decisions have led me to this situation.<br><br>After obtaining my high school diploma, my parents questioned me about my future plans. I responded with conviction, saying "computer science," discussing what I had always wanted to do. At the time, I was in Africa, and the idea of coming to Europe was not yet on the table. Following the advice of some people around me, I decided to steer my studies towards accounting, hoping to access a job and a better salary more quickly than in the field of computer science. However, this decision resulted in a wasted year without passing any exams.<br><br>Subsequently, the idea of coming to Europe emerged. I had to take language courses and pass a test to be eligible for a visa application. This process took almost an additional two years. Once in Germany, I continued with language courses, but a lack of information prevented me from realizing that I needed to reach a certain language level to enroll in the computer science field. Circumstances kept getting more complicated, and due to language and administrative constraints, I had to opt for a program that matched my language proficiency. Although this decision took me away from my initial ambition, I did my best to adapt.<br><br>Fortunately, destiny recently smiled upon me when I reconnected with an acquaintance who had transitioned into the field of computer science in France. This encounter enlightened me about the path I am currently on. My main obstacle was my lack of knowledge; otherwise, I would have taken action much earlier.<br><br>I'm not seeking excuses, as my choices were the result of personal decisions. However, now that I am better informed and understand the way forward, I am committed to persevering until I seize an opportunity. Starting late doesn't matter to me, as I am determined to make up for lost time through <span class="color_span">my perseverance</span> and <span class="color_span">ability</span> to progress rapidly.</P>

This skill has frequently enabled me to surpass the individuals I initially observed and imitated. As a result, I have consistently achieved my learning goals and established myself among the top performers in my environment.<br> My approach is not based on presumption but on my conviction of being able to bring real value.

                    <p>Preferring external evaluation to identify my strengths, I remain attentive to the inherent relativity of each situation. <span class="color_span">My openness to constructive criticism</span> demonstrates my desire for growth, while my ability to <span class="color_span">foster diplomacy in delicate moments</span> reflects my thoughtful approach. <br>Endowed with a <span class="color_span">courteous and discreet nature</span>, I approach my interactions with caution so as not to unnecessarily disturb others.

                    <h2>My <span>Defaults</span> As Person</h2>
                    <p>While often daunting, this self-evaluation step is crucial for my commitment to transparency and integrity towards my prospective employer. In this spirit, I find it necessary to list both the imperfections I have personally identified and those that have been brought to my attention by others. <br>One aspect that requires improvement on my part is <span class="color_span">my lack of self-confidence</span>. Although the roots of this attitude elude me, I am inclined to think that it partly stems from an excessive desire to remain humble. This character trait, which I find regrettable, is one that I am diligently working to amend. Over time, I observe progress, and I anticipate further improvement as certain circumstances evolve. <br>I also acknowledge my tendency towards <span class="color_span">laziness</span>, especially in situations I deem non-essential. However, I believe that using the term "laziness" can sometimes be excessive as it largely depends on the context. I am committed to investing more effort in circumstances where I don't immediately perceive the importance and stakes. <br>My third point of reflection concerns my <span class="color_span">impulsive reactions</span>, which primarily occur when I am overwhelmed with joy or satisfaction. This tendency might lead me to share information before it's fully concrete, particularly in areas that directly concern me. While this impulse can spark a form of enthusiasm, I recognize that it can lead to misunderstandings. <br>The feedback I've received from those around me highlights certain aspects I'm working to address. I may occasionally appear <span class="color_span">introverted</span>, although I aspire to greater openness. Furthermore, I acknowledge that my <span class="color_span">consideration of my health</span> needs improvement, particularly concerning physical exercise and dietary habits. Finally, it's true that I could be <span class="color_span">more socially present</span> by engaging more in activities with my friends and getting out more. <br>Although these flaws are far from making me proud, I take pride in my ability to openly recognize them and take concrete actions to correct them.</p>
